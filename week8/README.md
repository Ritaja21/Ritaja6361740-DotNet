# Week 8 - GIT Hands-On Assignment
 This week’s hands-on lab focuses on practicing **Git fundamentals and workflows**. The assignments guide through key Git operations such as creating branches, merging, resolving conflicts, using `.gitignore`, and pushing changes to a remote repository. These exercises aim to strengthen understanding of version control concepts essential for collaborative software development.

 ---
 ## Project Overview
 The Week 8 Git lab consists of five hands-on assignments, each designed to strengthen different aspects of Git and version control workflow:

1. **Git-T03-HOL_001 (Git 1)**  
   - Setup your machine with Git configuration.  
   - Integrate Notepad++ as the default Git editor.  
   - Add a file to the source code repository.

2. **Git-T03-HOL_002 (Git 2)**  
   - Implement the `.gitignore` command to ignore unwanted files and folders.  
   - Practice keeping the repository clean by excluding unnecessary files.

3. **Git-T03-HOL_003 (Git 3)**  
   - Construct a branch, make changes in the branch, and merge it with `master` (or `trunk`).  
   - Practice basic branching and merging operations.

4. **Git-T03-HOL_004 (Git 4)**  
   - Implement conflict resolution when multiple users update the `master` branch, resulting in conflicts with a branch’s modifications.  
   - Practice resolving merge conflicts manually or using Git tools.

5. **Git-T03-HOL_005 (Git 5)**  
   - Execute steps involving cleanup of the repository and pushing changes back to the remote Git repository.  
   - Ensure local and remote repositories are synchronized while practicing standard Git workflows.
