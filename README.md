# Cognizant DeepSkilling Assessment – DotNet Track

This repository contains weekly assignments and assessments completed as part of the **Cognizant DotNet DeepSkilling Program**.

Each week covers hands-on exercises on .NET concepts, object-oriented programming, data structures & algorithms, and real-world application design using C#.

```

## 📚 Week 1 Summary

In **Week 1**, I explored the following:

-  **Object-Oriented Design Patterns**: Singleton & Factory Method
-  **SOLID Principles**: Applied foundational principles of clean code
-  **Algorithms**: Implemented and analyzed Linear Search, Binary Search, and Recursive Logic

Projects are organized as standalone console applications inside the `week1/` folder.

## 📚 Week 2 Summary  
In **Week 2**, I explored the following:

-  **Advanced SQL Concepts:** Used `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `DENSE_RANK()` with `PARTITION BY` to rank data and handle ties within categories.

-  **Stored Procedures in SQL Server:** Created and executed stored procedures to insert employee records and return the total count of employees per department using input parameters.

-  **Unit Testing with NUnit:** Wrote structured unit tests for a basic calculator using `[TestFixture]`, `[SetUp]`, and `[TestCase]` attributes.

-  **Mocking with Moq:** Simulated external dependencies like email sending using the Moq library and dependency injection, ensuring isolated and testable code.

Projects and outputs are organized under the `week2/` folder.

## 📚 Week 3 Summary  
In **Week 3**, I focused on applying **Entity Framework (EF) Core** to implement Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in a real-world retail inventory scenario using SQL Server and C#.

-  **ORM with EF Core:** Learned how ORM bridges the gap between relational tables and C# classes. Created `Product` and `Category` models and mapped them to SQL tables using EF Core.

-  **DbContext & Connection Setup:** Configured `AppDbContext` with `UseSqlServer()` to connect to the SQL Server database. Defined `DbSet<Product>` and `DbSet<Category>` for database operations.

-  **EF Core CLI & Migrations:** Used `dotnet ef migrations add` and `dotnet ef database update` to generate schema and apply changes to the database.

-  **Async CRUD Operations:** Inserted initial data using `AddRangeAsync()` and `SaveChangesAsync()`, and retrieved data using `ToListAsync()`, `FindAsync()`, and `FirstOrDefaultAsync()` with LINQ.

-  **Validation via SSMS:** Verified that the data was correctly inserted and tables were created by checking SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

Projects and outputs are organized under the `week3/` folder.

##  📚 Week 4 Summary
-  Built multiple RESTful Web APIs using .NET Core with CRUD operations and action verbs (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)

-  Implemented JWT authentication and role-based access using `[Authorize]` with custom roles

-  Created Custom Filters for authorization and global exception handling

-  Integrated Swagger (OpenAPI) for API documentation and testing

-  Enabled CORS to allow frontend and Postman access to APIs

-  Developed a real-time chat system using Kafka:

   -  KafkaChatAPI: Sends messages to Kafka
   - KafkaChatConsumer: Console app to receive messages
   - KafkaChatClient: WinForms UI to send messages via API

 Organized all outputs and projects under the `week4/` folder
