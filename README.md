# Cognizant DeepSkilling Assessment – DotNet Track

This repository contains weekly assignments and assessments completed as part of the **Cognizant DotNet DeepSkilling Program**.

Each week covers hands-on exercises on .NET concepts, object-oriented programming, data structures & algorithms, and real-world application design using C#.

## 📚 Week 1 Summary

In **Week 1**, I explored the following:

- 🔹 **Object-Oriented Design Patterns**: Singleton & Factory Method
- 🔹 **SOLID Principles**: Applied foundational principles of clean code
- 🔹 **Algorithms**: Implemented and analyzed Linear Search, Binary Search, and Recursive Logic

Projects are organized as standalone console applications inside the `week1/` folder.

## 📚 Week 2 Summary  
In **Week 2**, I explored the following:

- 🔹 **Advanced SQL Concepts:** Used `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, and `DENSE_RANK()` with `PARTITION BY` to rank data and handle ties within categories.

- 🔹 **Stored Procedures in SQL Server:** Created and executed stored procedures to insert employee records and return the total count of employees per department using input parameters.

- 🔹 **Unit Testing with NUnit:** Wrote structured unit tests for a basic calculator using `[TestFixture]`, `[SetUp]`, and `[TestCase]` attributes.

- 🔹 **Mocking with Moq:** Simulated external dependencies like email sending using the Moq library and dependency injection, ensuring isolated and testable code.

Projects and outputs are organized under the `week2/` folder.
